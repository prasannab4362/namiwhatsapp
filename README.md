NamiwhatsCRM gives you the superpower to automate replies, manage a shared team inbox, and track deals seamlessly—all from one clean dashboard.

## What you get out of the box

- **Shared inbox** on the official WhatsApp Business API — multiple
  agents working one number, per-conversation assignment, status, and
  notes.
- **Contacts + tags + custom fields**, CSV import, deduplication.
- **Sales pipelines** (Kanban) with deals linked to conversations.
- **Broadcasts** with Meta-approved templates, delivery + read
  tracking, per-recipient variable substitution.
- **No-code automations** — triggers on inbound messages, new
  contacts, keywords, or schedule; conditional branches, waits,
  tags, webhooks. Visual builder.
- **AI reply assistant** — bring your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini key
  (stored encrypted; no per-seat AI fee, your data stays yours).
  One-click AI-drafted replies in the inbox, plus an optional
  auto-reply bot with a per-conversation cap and clean human handoff.
  Add a **knowledge base** (FAQs, policies, product docs) and it
  answers from your own content — hybrid retrieval (Postgres full-text,
  or semantic pgvector when an embeddings key is set).
- **Real-time dashboard** — response times, daily volume, pipeline
  value, cross-module activity feed.
- **Team accounts** — invite teammates by link, role-based access
  (owner / admin / agent / viewer), ownership transfer. Every install
  is account-scoped, so one shared inbox can be staffed by a whole
  team. Solo use stays single-user with zero setup.
- **Account management** — email, password, avatar, global sign-out.
- **Public REST API** (`/api/v1`) with scoped, revocable API keys —
  build your own automations on top of your CRM. See
  [docs/public-api.md](./docs/public-api.md).
- **MCP server** — drive your CRM from Claude, Cursor, and other AI
  assistants over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
  Read-only by default, opt-in writes. See [docs/mcp.md](./docs/mcp.md)
  (server in [`mcp-server/`](./mcp-server)).

## Why fork this?

This is a **template**, not a product. Forking means you get:

- **Full ownership** — your code, your Supabase project, your domain,
  your data. No SaaS lock-in, no seat pricing, no trust dance.
- **Full customisation** — add the fields your team needs, remove the
  modules you don't, redesign anything. The stack is boring on
  purpose (Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind) so the learning curve is
  short.
- **Zero ops to start** — [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/web-apps-hosting)
  Managed Node.js deploys a fork in a few clicks. No Docker, no
  Kubernetes, no infra team needed.
  ([See below ↓](#-deploy-on-hostinger-recommended))
- **Real security primitives** — token encryption (AES-256-GCM), RLS
  on every table, HMAC-verified webhooks, CSP, rate limiting, CI
  typecheck/build on every PR.

Not a framework. Not an SDK. A concrete, working CRM you can stand up
in an afternoon and make yours.

## Quick start

```bash
# Fork or clone repository
git clone https://github.com/prasannab4362/namiwhatsapp.git
cd namiwhatsapp
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in Supabase + Meta creds
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. You'll be redirected to `/login` (or
`/dashboard` if already signed in).

## 🚀 Deploy on Hostinger (recommended)

**NamiwhatsCRM is built to run on [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/web-apps-hosting).**
It's the path we test, document, and recommend — and the fastest way
to get a production-grade CRM live without owning a VPS or a
Kubernetes cluster.

### Why Hostinger?

| | |
|---|---|
| **One-click Git deploy** | Connect your fork, push to `main`, Hostinger builds and ships it. No SSH, no Docker, no CI to wire up — this repo's own `main` deploys this way. |
| **Managed Node.js** | Next.js 16 (App Router, server actions, ISR) runs out of the box on [Premium, Business, and Cloud](https://www.hostinger.com/web-apps-hosting) shared plans. You don't manage Node versions, processes, or reverse proxies. |
| **Free SSL + free domain** | Automatic Let's Encrypt on your custom domain (or a free one included with annual plans). HTTPS is on by default — required for the WhatsApp Business webhook. |
| **Global CDN + LiteSpeed** | Static assets cached at the edge, dynamic routes served from LiteSpeed. Snappy dashboards out of the box, no Cloudflare setup required. |
| **Env vars + logs in hPanel** | Set `SUPABASE_*`, `WHATSAPP_*`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the panel — no `.env` on the server. Live application logs in the same UI. |
| **DDoS protection + daily backups** | Built-in, no add-ons. The webhook endpoint is a public target — having protection at the edge matters. |
| **Cheaper than a VPS** | Plans start at a few dollars a month — order-of-magnitude less than a comparable managed Node.js host, and you don't pay extra for the database (that's Supabase). |
| **24/7 human support** | Live chat support in 20+ languages — useful when your CRM is the thing your team relies on to talk to customers. |

### The 60-second version

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub (`prasannab4362/namiwhatsapp`).
2. In **hPanel → Websites → Create**, pick **Node.js** and connect
   your fork.
3. Paste your Supabase + Meta env vars into hPanel.
4. Push to `main`. Hostinger builds and serves it. Done.

> _Note: NamiwhatsCRM is MIT-licensed and runs anywhere Node.js does
> (Vercel, Railway, your own VPS). Hostinger is recommended, not
> required._
